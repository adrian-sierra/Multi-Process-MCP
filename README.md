# Multi-Process-MCP
This project was completed during my Operating Systems course. 

The concept of the project is take an input file that lists various commands that should be performed by the CLI and would execute if they are valid commands with valid arguments. The project adds a multi process feature by having multiple processes working on the input file and thus increasing the efficiency of the application. 

All the code was written using C.
